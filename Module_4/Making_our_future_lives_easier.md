# Practice Quiz: Making our future lives easier
**Total points:** 8 
**Score:** 100%

## Question 1
Which proactive practice can you implement to make troubleshooting issues in a program easier when they happen again, or face other similar issues?

- Automate rollbacks.
- **Create and update documentation.**
- Use a test environment.
- Set up unit tests.

*Documentation that includes good instructions on how to resolve an issue can assist in resolving the same or similar issue in the future.*

## Question 2
Which of the following is a good example of mixing and matching resources on a single server so that the running services make the best possible use of all resources?

- Run a RAM intensive application and a CPU intensive application on a server.
- Run two applications that are CPU intensive between two servers.
- Run a CPU intensive application on one server and an I/O intensive application on another server.
- **Run two applications that are RAM and I/O intensive on a server.**

*Resources on each of the two servers are being underutilized.*

## Question 3
One strategy for debugging involves explaining the problem to yourself out loud. What is this technique known as?

- Monitoring
- **Rubber ducking**
- Testing
- Ticketing

*Rubber ducking is the process of explaining a problem to a "rubber duck," or rather yourself, to better understand the problem.*

## Question 4
When deploying software, what is a canary? 

- A test for how components of a program interact with each other.
- A test of a program’s components.
- A small section of code.
- **A test deployment to a subset of production hosts.**

*Reminiscent of the old term "canary in a coal mine," a canary is a test deployment of our software, just to see what happens.*

## Question 5
Which term describes a component of a system that might fail logically or physically?

- I/O intensive
- CPU intensive
- A problem domain
- **A failure domain**

*A failure domain is a logical or physical component of a system that might fail.*

## Question 6
What is the primary goal of change management in virtualized environments?

- Maximizing disruptions and system changes.
- Rapidly implementing changes to VM infrastructure.
- **Ensuring system integrity and minimizing disruption.**
- Safeguarding VMs from unauthorized access.

*The goal of virtualized change management is to maintain system integrity and minimize disruptions by following a structured approach when making changes to the VM’s infrastructure.*

## Question 7
When should you NOT use Docker to manage applications?

- **Running a large, monolithic legacy application.**
- Using Docker to deploy an application that has already been packaged as containers.
- When you are developing a microservice-based application.
- Running an application across hundreds or thousands of servers at internet scale.

*Due to their complexity and resource requirements, legacy monolithic applications can be challenging to containerize and manage efficiently with Docker.*

## Question 8
When it comes to software development, what does the term "problem domain" mean?

- The failure of different subsystems within a complex system.
- A technical solution to a system failure.
- The process of manually solving the problem using illustrative datasets.
- **The scope and complexity of a problem that needs to be solved.**

*Problem domain refers to the scope and complexity of a specific problem. It involves understanding the nuances of the problem to more effectively develop solutions.*
