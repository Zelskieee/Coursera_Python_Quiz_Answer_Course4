## Question 1
What is the function of pip3 in Python?

- Acts as a plots library for Python.
- Creates graphical user interfaces.
- Runs Python scripts.
- **Downloads and configures new python modules.**

## Question 2
If you did not write the Python program and don’t have access to the source code, what should you examine to determine where the program is running and any errors that are occurring? 

- **You should examine the program’s surrounding environment.**
- Figure out where the program is executing and identify any errors.
- The results of the grantaccess command.
- The results of the pip3 command.

## Question 3
What is one of the primary purposes of matplotlib?

- It serves as a Python code editor for writing and debugging scripts.
- **It is primarily used for visualizing 2D plots of arrays and data.**
- It provides an object-oriented API for creating graphical user interfaces.
- It focuses on numerical mathematics and extends the Python language.

## Question 4
How did you resolve the MissingColumnError?

- You rewrote the Python script from scratch.
- You used the "ls" command to check for errors.
- **You added the missing column name to the data.csv file.**
- You used the "chmod 777" command.

## Question 5
What causes Python to display an ImportError message? 

- **The import statement is unable to import a library.**
- The import statement encountered a permissions problem. 
- The import statement uses incorrect syntax. 
- The import statement cannot find a library to import.

- Redesigns of the user interface.
- **More users.**
- **Future software upgrades.**
- **Current bug reports.**

## Question 7
Why is effective debugging an essential skill for Python developers, and how does it contribute to the overall success of a project?

- **Debugging helps identify and rectify errors, leading to improved script functionality and reliability.**
- Debugging helps developers gain a deeper understanding of Python syntax.
- Effective debugging ensures that scripts run without any issues.
- Debugging allows developers to showcase their coding skills.

## Question 8
What is the third step in the process of debugging, following the identification of a bug's cause?

- **Reproducing the bug.**
- Deleting the entire codebase.
- Writing new code to fix the bug.
- Reporting the bug to a supervisor.

## Question 9
After successfully fixing the code and resolving the errors in the provided content, what is the recommended next step to ensure the continued functionality and reliability of the script?

- **Test the script thoroughly to confirm that the errors are resolved.**
- Reinstall the Python interpreter for optimal performance.
- Immediately share the fixed code with colleagues.
- Delete the script to start fresh with a clean slate.

## Question 10
Why is it essential for developers to isolate specific issues or errors in software when troubleshooting? Select all that apply.

- **Effective isolation enables targeted problem-solving and prevents broader system disruptions.**
- **Isolating issues simplifies the code and eliminates unnecessary complexity.**
- Isolating issues allows developers to work on multiple problems simultaneously.
- Isolating issues reduces the need for comprehensive testing.
