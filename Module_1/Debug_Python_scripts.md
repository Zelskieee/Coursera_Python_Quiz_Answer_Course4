**Total points:** 10
**Score:** 100%

## Question 1
When debugging scripts, what is the primary type of issue that effective debugging can help address?

- Issues related to hardware compatibility.
- **Syntax errors and typos in the code.**
- Performance optimization and speed enhancements.
- Problems with network connectivity.

## Question 2
In the lab, what was the recommended solution to address the issue in the Python script where two different data types (string and int) need to be concatenated?

- Check for indentation errors in the script.
- Modify the file path in the script.
- Add the necessary import statements to the script.
- **Convert the integer to a string using the str() function.**

## Question 3
In the debugging process described, what is the purpose of replacing the original print statement with the following statement?

print("hello " + name + ", your random number is " + str(number))

- **The purpose is to ensure the print statement correctly concatenates the name and random number with the appropriate data types.**
- The purpose is to make the print statement more concise and shorter.
- The purpose is to fix a syntax error in the print statement.
- The purpose is to remove the print statement from the script entirely.

## Question 4
Which of the following statements are true about adding two different data types directly in Python? 

- In Python, you cannot add two different data types directly unless you are debugging. 
- In Python, you cannot add two different data types directly.
- **In Python, you can directly add two different data types when necessary.**
- In Python, as long as the syntax is correct, you can directly add two or more different data types.

## Question 5
What does the error message TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly tell you? 

- There is a syntax error in the code. 
- **Something in the code is trying to concatenate a string and an integer.**
- Something in the code is trying to convert a string into an integer.
- The string within this code is missing.

## Question 6
You receive the following error message (TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly). What do you need to do to resolve this error? 

- **Change the number into a string.**
- Replace the string with a set of integers.
- Switch to another programming language.
- Rewrite the code. 

## Question 7
In the lab, you encountered an error message that indicates a problem with concatenating a string and an integer. To figure out the root cause of this bug, what step did you take next in the lab after successfully reproducing the error?

- Reinstalled the SSH client.
- Rebooted the virtual machine.
- **Examined the code within the script.**
- Checked the internet connection.

## Question 8
When a bug is found in a software program during testing, what is the best way to communicate it to the right individuals(s)? 

- Email the testing and development department.
- Ignore it.
- **Document it and notify relevant team members.**
- Post it on social media.

## Question 9
A recurring problem can be defined as what? 

- A problem that can only be resolved with a system reboot.
- **A problem that occurs consistently under the same set of conditions.**
- A problem that occurs only once.
- A problem that occurs randomly, without a predictable pattern.

## Question 10
You are testing software and uncover a recurring problem. Later, that day, the IT department pushes a system update. When you go back to the testing, the problem is gone. What happened? 

- Something in the system settings resolved the problem permanently.
- The problem was a software issue.
- The problem was a hardware failure.
- **Something in the system settings was causing the problem.**
